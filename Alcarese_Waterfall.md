Waterfall Method

##Requirements and Definitions
1-2 weeks
This project is to create a database of users that are assigned roles of Admin, Instructor, and Student. Each role will have different permissions and will have access to different functions than the other roles. Admins for example will be able to create courses, assign professors to those courses and look at User information. Instructors will be able to view their schedules and assign grades and update students GPA but will lack the functionality that admins have. Students will be able to view their GPA and regiser for courses. They wont be able to access anyone elses but their own IDs.

##System and Software Design 
Full Durration 
C++ will be used for the driving code and the database code is still undecided. The function will work by initializing with the users in the database and then a user will "sign in" determining gaining access to their profile and their assigned role. 

##Implimentation and Unit Testing
