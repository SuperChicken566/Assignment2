Incremental Method

(Could include more in depth analysis of iterations/more iterations)

##Initial Version
In the intial version of the program I would create the base class without the student, instructor, or admin. This first version would be created
to ensure that the users are created corectly and that the informtion can be accessed  properly. 

##Intermediate versions 
These versions would be dedicated to creating the subclasses and corresponding functions and ensuring that they are working properly. We ass time
goes on we will add more functions and informaton for each role. Bug testing will occur throughout the project. 

##Final Version 
Final version will include all functions, information and accompanying database with information.
