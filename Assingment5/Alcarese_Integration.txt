Integration and Configuration Method

##Requirement and Specification
Requirements are that we need a code that can access an SQL-based database to allow a user to run functions and access information from that 
database within their confidentiality limits. Admins, Instructors and students will all have different roled and different levels of accessiblity
on the system. 

##Component Analysis
Taken from this: https://github.com/Ri2parna/Course-Registration-System
This seems to be a PHP and Css program that is very close to what we need to accomplish. I like the inclusion of the User/Pass system that the
Admin or Instructor needs to provide. Maybe we could add a function to the admin class that sets the password for the Student that they would use
to logon. 

##Required Modificaiton
The elephant in the room is that we want to use Python and SQL so we would have to essentially start from scratch but having access to code that
is already completed could make development of our code easier.

##System design with Reuse
This is almost non-applicable since the codes are writen in different languages. Function should be simlar though well just have to go about it
in a different way. 

##Development and Integration 
Using the provided code architecture as our foundation, creating classses, variables and driving code should not rewuire much work. 

##System Validation
Validation would come by ensureing that all roles and their respective functions are working properly.
